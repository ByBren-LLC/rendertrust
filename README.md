# RenderTrust

**Harness any GPU—without ever surrendering your raw files.** RenderTrust is the open‑source edge AI platform that balances **privacy**, **security**, and **elasticity** for creators of all sizes.

## Why RenderTrust Matters

In today's landscape, creative teams—from solo YouTubers to global studios—face three key barriers:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Studios cannot risk leaking scripts, storyboards, or unreleased footage to black‑box SaaS platforms.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Indie creators are priced out of large cloud render farms and stuck with local CPUs.
3. **Ecosystem Fragmentation**: Every model and workflow has its own API, making integration a full‑time job.

RenderTrust tears down these walls by:

- **End‑to‑end encryption**: Your prompts, frames, and metadata remain encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Edge‑first mesh**: Community GPUs, on‑prem servers, and cloud overflow work interchangeably under a unified protocol (A2A).
- **Open standard**: JSON‑RPC A2A + optional MCP integration means any vendor or developer can plug in without re‑inventing the wheel.

Whether you're running your own nodes or tapping into public GPUs, RenderTrust ensures your IP stays under your keys—while giving you the scale and flexibility of a global compute network.
